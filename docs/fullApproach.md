### Full Approach

- Created a [design document](./design.md) to make notes on the brief
  - laid out initial plan for overall design
- Used Jest to test-drive the creation of a BankAccount class
- After recent external review, aimed for a Red-Green-Commit-Refactor-Commit loop in the process
- returned to design document and client brief as required to clarify and update thoughts on approach
- Made choice that balances can become negative
  - no specific instructions or demonstration in the acceptance criteria for this case
  - in a real-world test this would have been a point to return to client and clarify
  - laid out possible options in design document, in case this needs to be revisited
- Moved on to StatementPrinter class once the BankAccount class was able to store transactions, and allow withdrawing/depositing
- Decision was made early on in design document that this would be a separate class in order to adhere more closely to Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Continued to use Jest to test-drive implementation of StatementPrinter class
- Once unit tests were passing and covering the responsibilities of the StatementPrinter class, this was integrated into the BankAccount class
  - mocked using Jest mocks in the unit tests
  - not mocked for the feature tests
- this exposed further requirements to meet the criteria
  - statement printed dates from most recent to least recent
  - the calculation of balance needed to be adjusted as a result
- Linting was brought in to catch any syntax errors and bad practices
- Continued refactoring the code to remove unnecessary variables
  - selected variables left in to aid the readability of the code
  - methods extracted to continue with SRP
  - methods that could be made private, made private
    - unsure whether the transactions property of BankAccount should be private
      - pro: stops it being accessed outside
      - con: unavailable to unit testing BankAccount, alternatives could give false positives
- Further feature tests added
  - exposed blind spot in Jest mocking
    - console.log spy was passing subsequent tests due to using .toHaveBeenCalled() instead of .toHaveBeenLAstCalled()
- The existence of Continuous Integration remembered by me at this point
  - config files for Travis and GitHub Actions added
  - Travis CI currently blocked, so focused on GitHub actions
  - CI exposed issue with toLocaleString() used by StatementPrinter
    - flips months and days
    - local tests run with en-gb -> remote tests using en-us
- dateFormatter updated to no longer use toLocaleString()
- Readme pushed to GitHub for code review
- Self-assessment form carried out:
  - highlighted possible areas for further encapsulation
  - made me return to the consideration of a Transaction class
  - retry testing approach (Behaviour over State)
  - mock Date objects
  - made transactions property of BankAccount private
- Date objects mocked for new Transaction class and Feature tests
- Submitted for coach review
  - feedback received:
    - Rearrange Folder Structure
    - remove interfaces not in specification
    - Throw error if withdrawal would take account balance negative
    - Sort Feature test (not an integration test)
    - calculate balance at runtime of statement() from transaction history
    - Un-couple BankAccount, Transaction, and StatementPrinter classes (Dependency Injection)
    - Separate statement class into methods with SRP
    - rename methods for clarity
